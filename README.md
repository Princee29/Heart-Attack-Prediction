**Problem Statement**

Amidst an abundance of medical data and the growing field of Data Science, numerous startups have taken up the challenge of developing indicators to predict potential diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) stand as the leading cause of global mortality, claiming an estimated 17.9 million lives annually, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Among CVDs, heart failure is a prevalent occurrence. Timely detection and management are crucial for individuals with cardiovascular disease or those at high risk due to factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, or existing conditions. Here, the aid of machine learning models can prove invaluable. By automating disease prediction, we aim to tackle this natural problem and, with the assistance of AI techniques, move on to address the next challenge.
